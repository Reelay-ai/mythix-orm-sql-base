SQL base support for Mythix ORM

Mythix ORM aims to replace Sequelize and the few other terrible solutions that the poor destitute Node community has to work with. Mythix ORM is not yet quite ready for prime time however, so please check back soon!

This module isn't intended to be used by itself. It is a support module for other SQL-based database drivers.
